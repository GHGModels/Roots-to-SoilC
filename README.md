# A deeper look at root C pools and the vertical distribution of soil C pools under maize and reconstructed prairie - data and code

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/68629210.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/68629210)

This repo contains most of the data and code used to create the manuscript submitted to SOIL. When I initiated this repo over two years ago (by adding code that was even older), my organization and coding skills were. . .very bad. I have been working on them, but am still doing a lot of cleaning/commenting of what is here.  

If you are looking for examples of how to code, don't use these scripts. If you have analysis questions for me and you are overwhelmed by what you see here, please contact me and I can help you out.
