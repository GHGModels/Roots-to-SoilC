## Introduction
Prairie-formed mollisols support some of the world's most productive agriculture, but declines in levels of soil organic matter threaten the perpetuity of this production.  Soil organic matter losses coincide with a shift from perennial plant systems to annual cropping systems which introduced frequent tillage, subsurface drainage, and differences in organic matter inputs, including considerably different rooting systems. The effects of changes in aboveground processes such as increased soil disturbance and aeration, addition of fertilizers, and changes in residue amount and quality have been studied extensively (cite, cite, cite).  The role played by changes in rooting systems, on the other hand, is difficult to study and has received less attention.  

In this paper, we distinguish between a root C pool (C found in any material that can still be visually identified as a root) and a soil organic C pool (the rest of the soil organic C).  Root growth allows the placement of plant tissue directly into the soil, creating a root C pool as deep as the rooting system goes.  Some studies suggest that root C pool size and soil organic C pool size have a direct relationship and most soil organic matter is derived from roots.  This would mean that a change in root inputs, such as switching from annual to perennial systems, would have a direct impact on soil organic matter even deep into the soil profile. However, very few direct comparisons of annual and perennial rooting systems have been made and our understanding of soil C dynamics decreases as depth increases.  

On average, half of the world's soil C is found below 20 cm (Rumpel and Kogel-Knabner, 2011). However, only 30% of the world's roots are found below 20 cm (Jobbagy and Jackson, 2000).  In the Central US, this phenomenon was observed as early as 1935 when Weaver found 41-74% of the total soil organic matter, but only 23-29% of the total roots in a tallgrass prairie were found below 20 cm.  Similarly, Gill and colleagues (1999) found 77% of total soil organic matter and only 43% of the total root mass below 15 cm in a shortgrass steppe. Although this disproportionate relationship between root and soil C distribution is well known, and has been for some time, no widely accepted explanation exists to justify the magnitude of difference between the amount of C in the root pool and the amount of C in the soil pool (Gill et al., 1999, Rumpel and Kogel-Knabner 2011).    

Many factors interact to determine how much C is transferred between pools and how much C remains in a particular pool.  Temperature, moisture, and O2 availability are the most important environmental variables controlling the rate of decomposition and soil texture and existing soil C levels determine the length of time C remains in the soil.  The C:N ratio of the organic matter being decomposed also plays a key role in both the rate of decomposition and the fate of the decomposed organic matter.  Temperature, moisture, O2, soil texture, and soil C levels all vary with depth and contribute to partial explanations of the size discrepancy between root and soil C pools. However, previous studies which measured roots and/or organic matter with depth have neglected to examine the change of any indicators of organic matter quality with depth, such as composition or C:N ratio.  Carbon:N ratio differences between maize and prairie root C pools are also unknown.  A more-detailed look at properties of root C pools is greatly needed.  

We examined the belowground reconstruction of native vegetation on a Mollisol after >100 years of annual cropping to gain a unique perspective on characteristics of root inputs that would not necessarily be noticed in established prairie systems, but that contribute to dynamics of the belowground ecosystem.  We examined differences between maize and reconstructed prairie root pools down to one meter to serve two separate, but related, purposes: 1) Inform our understanding of the impact and lasting effect of shifting millions of acres from perennial to annual vegetation and; 2) Contribute to an explanation of why levels of soil organic C found below 20 cm are greater than expected.  In comparing the root C pool of a reconstructed prairie system to the root C pool of a maize cropping system we asked the following questions: 1) How does the quantity, distribution, and C:N ratio of the root C pool differ with depth and between these native perennial and non-native annual ecosystems? 2) What do these differences in inputs tell us about the historical belowground ecosystem under which these soils developed and the systems under which these soils continue to change?
