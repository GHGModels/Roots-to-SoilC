## Checklist for giving to coauthors  
- [] Fix corn root curve and prairie negative root value  
- [] Address Castellano's comments  
- [] Make soil characteristics table  
- [] Improve figures for smaller size  
- [] *Incorporate literature*  
- [] Write Abstract
- [x] Fix all the tables, really - okay for now
- [] Maize planting dates  
- [] Make bibliography
     
     

Need citations for: 

Soil organic matter losses
Roles of increases aeration
         Addition of fertilizer
         Changes in residue amount and quality  
Slower increases at deeper depths than shallower depths may be indicative that accumulation there is more dependent upon the carryover of roots from previous years than at shallower depths.  

Root growth slows as systems become more established.

    - Maybe high prairie root C:N ratios is why we don't see huge increases after restoration - not just       soil texture
