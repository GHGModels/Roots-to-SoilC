Abstract = {{This study determined the effect of two tree planting methods (woodland
   and a silvopastoral agroforestry system) on the soil bulk density and
   organic carbon content of a grassland site in lowland England. Soil
   organic carbon was measured in pasture, silvopastoral tree, and woodland
   treatments at six depths representative of 0-150 cm. Fourteen years
   after tree planting, the organic carbon content in the surface soil
   layer (0-10 cm) was greatest in the pasture (6.0 g 100 g(-1)) and least
   in the woodland (4.6 g 100 g(-1)); the value (5.3 g 100 g(-1)) below the
   silvopastoral trees was intermediate. In the 10-20 cm layer, the organic
   carbon content in the woodland was 13\% lower than the pasture. No
   treatment effects on soil carbon were detected below 20 cm. Possible
   reasons for the decline in surface soil carbon include a decline in
   grass cover and reduced soil water content Measurements of above ground
   carbon storage by the trees indicated that tree planting increased
   overall carbon storage, with the silvopastoral system predicted to
   achieve a higher level of carbon storage than equivalent areas of
   separate woodland and pasture. A power analysis indicates that a
   prohibitively large number of replicates is needed to ensure a lower
   than 20\% risk of falsely concluding no treatment differences at
   individual depth increments below 10 cm and cumulative depths extending
   below 40 cm. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V. All
